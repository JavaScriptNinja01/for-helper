# for-helper
The for-helper library provides a set of utility classes and methods to simplify common loop operations in Java.

One of the main features of the library is the For class, which allows for concise and readable iteration over collections and arrays. The For class provides a fluent API for specifying loop conditions, step sizes, and iteration directions, and supports both indexed and non-indexed loops.

In addition to the For class, the library includes several other utility classes, such as LoopUtil and RangeUtil, which provide various loop-related operations and calculations.

The for-helper library is designed to improve the readability and maintainability of loop-heavy Java code by reducing the amount of boilerplate code and providing a more natural syntax for loop constructs. It is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with existing Java code.

To get started with for-helper, simply add the library to your project's dependencies and start using the provided classes and methods in your code. We welcome contributions and feedback from the Java community to help make for-helper even better!
